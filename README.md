# Eat-Da-Burger II

Eat-Da-Burger II is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app will stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

This is a modified version of the BurgerTime application using sequelize
